# Command decisions are made within this program and could be made within
# other subprograms if that was simpler for code reuse.
# Functions for calculations for command decisions are stored in packetmath.py

Controlled in this autopilot program:
    1) vehicle speed
    2) vehicle heading
    3) when a package is dropped
    4) communication with zip_sim.py using sys.stdin and sys.stdout
       pipes that are defined in zip_sim.py
